# pythonsdk-tests

This project is a wrapper to use onapsdk toolkit to onboard and 
instantiate services on ONAP

## Temporary help section

A basic example is implemented in the python file

- run.py

The global datas defined in these files (see input_datas) shall be 
adapted to your environment.

In addition you must define your service in directory templates/vnf-services
and create zip file for heat template templates/heat_files.
See ubuntu16test as example

### Prepare your environment and run tests

- Clone the project (using instantiation branch)

```shell
git clone https://gerrit.onap.org/r/testsuite/pythonsdk-tests.git
```

- Create a virtual environment and clone the python-onapsdk

```shell
virtualenv my_test
source my_test/bin/activate
git clone git@gitlab.com:Orange-OpenSource/lfn/onap/python-onapsdk.git -b develop
cd python-onapsdk
pip install -e .
cd ..
pip install -e .
```

- Set global settings configuration files with all required input datas
  including the dynamic forwarding port for ssh tunnel in
  src/onaptests/configuration/settings.py

- Export the setting file in a environment variable
  ```shell
  export ONAP_PYTHON_SDK_SETTINGS="onaptests.configuration.settings"
  ``` 

- (optional) Open ssh tunnel towards your openlab setting a dynamic port forward (by default 1080):
  ```shell
  ssh user@onap.pod4.opnfv.fr -D 1080
  ```

- Once the different input datas are updated in run_*.py files and 
  that the templates files for your service are defined, start to run the different steps:

  ```shell
  python run.py
  ```

- By default, all the logs are stored in the file pythonsdk.debug.log.
  The file name and location can be set in the settings.py
