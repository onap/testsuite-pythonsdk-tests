# Local helm chart directory

It is adviced that a remote repository is used for simulators, to reduce
complexity and avoid mistakes related to the duplicate code, submodules etc.

However, helm charts can be placed here, too. The folder name with a release
will be the release name. For example, the folder 'X_simulator' would be the
release name for Helm.
